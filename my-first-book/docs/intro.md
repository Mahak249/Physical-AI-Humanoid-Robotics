# Welcome to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **AI-Native Interactive Textbook** for Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This comprehensive resource is designed to guide you through the exciting world of embodied intelligence, where artificial intelligence meets physical robotics.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and understand the physical world through robotic embodiments. Unlike traditional AI that operates solely in the digital realm, Physical AI combines:

- **Perception**: Understanding the environment through sensors (cameras, LIDAR, IMUs)
- **Cognition**: Making intelligent decisions based on sensor data
- **Action**: Manipulating the physical world through actuators
- **Learning**: Continuously improving through interaction and experience

## What You'll Learn

This textbook covers the complete stack of technologies and concepts needed to build intelligent humanoid robots:

### 1. **Foundations**
- Introduction to robotics middleware (ROS 2)
- Robot simulation environments
- Basic robot kinematics and dynamics

### 2. **Simulation & Testing**
- Gazebo: Industry-standard robot simulator
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim: GPU-accelerated physics simulation
- Creating and testing robot models in simulation

### 3. **AI & Learning**
- Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models
- Imitation learning and reinforcement learning
- Foundation models for robotics

### 4. **Hardware & Integration**
- Humanoid robot platforms
- Sensors and actuators
- Real-world deployment strategies

### 5. **Advanced Topics**
- Multi-modal learning
- Sim-to-real transfer
- Safety and robustness in physical AI
